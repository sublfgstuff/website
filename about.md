		<p>Hey! Nice to meet you. I am Rajnil Mukherjee, a 3rd year physics major doing my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, Punjab, India. I was born and brought up in the beautiful city of Kolkata, and completed my high school from there itself. I am an aspiring astrophysicist, the drummer in my college rock band and currently (I still don't know how) the co-convener of Turing--the Computer Club of IISER Mohali. </p>

				<p>As said before, I am an aspiring astrophysicst. However, unlike other astro geeks out there, my GK is very bad, so don't expect me to go answer queries like what that star is--I don't know okay? Catalogues are there for a reason. I am a physics major, and you can learn more about my projects and experiences here:</p>

					<h3>What's up?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Well, I just came back from a trip to Bangalore in the summer, doing a project on possible Fermi Bubble analogs under Dr. Santanu Mondal here at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). Going to Bangalore was one of the best decisions of my life, and now that I have come back to IISER for my 5th Sem, I am kinda missing it. *sob* </p>

					<h3>Jobless after classes?</h3>

				<p>Sometimes I wish I was. I am a very avid drummer, and play with my friends as a part of a band in my college. I also dabble in front-end web development, and watch a lot of anime, not to mention that I got a club to handle. I used to read a lot too, but it kind of stopped sometime during my +2. However, I have started picking it up again here in Bangalore, so less gooo!  </p>
