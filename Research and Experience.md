<p>Ah well, as the title goes, I am going to talk about my research and experiences here. An academically young guy like me doesn't have much to talk about I know, but I do plan to expand this section futher in the future. You can find my current CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GSLhn476QdRaRGjjKtxBaucGGkMRotpD/view?usp=share_link"> here </a>. You can also find my ORCID <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2694-8054"> here </a> (although right now, it is nothing much to look at)</p>

		<h3>Summer 2023 </h3>
		<p>Currently I am working under Dr. Santanu Mondal at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) Bangalore. Right now I am studying the high energy gamma ray emission of various galaxies using Fermi LAT data. An extremely engaging project to work on, and I am learning a lot of new things.</p>

		<h3>Summer 2022</h3>
		<p>I took up a reading project under Dr. Prasenjit Das at IISER Mohali, trying to simulate phase transitions in spin lattice systems using Monte Carlo techniques. I was primarily trying to replicate the results of the paper by Steinberg et al. This was my first ever project, and again I gained a very valuable exposure to the world of academia, thanks to Dr. Das.</p>
