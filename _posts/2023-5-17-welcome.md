Welcome to Musings, and in general, welcome to my site! I am still working on this, and I hope to make it better in the future. I hope to add more content to this site, and I hope you enjoy it. This site is meant to be a primary source of information about me, and I hope it serves that purpose well. You can also approach me on my socials, which you can find in the footer. I hope you enjoy your stay here!

You can also contact me via the form given below. I periodically check the form, and will get back to you as soon as possible. 

PS: The picture you see here is from somewhere in the middle of my trip to Skandagiri, Bangalore. I had gone to IIA Bangalore for a project and took this trip with my friends.

See ya!
